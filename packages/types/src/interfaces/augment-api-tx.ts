       * 
       * The second part `ethereum_header` is the Ethereum block header which included/generated this
       * receipt, we need to provide this as part of proof, because in Darwinia Relay, we only have
       * last confirmed block's MMR root, don't have previous blocks, so we need to include this to
       * provide the `receipt_root` inside it, we will need to verify validation by checking header hash.
       * 
       * The third part `mmr_proof` is the mmr proof generate according to
       * `(member_index=[ethereum_header.number], last_index=last_confirmed_block_header.number)`
       * it can prove that the `ethereum_header` is the chain which is committed by last confirmed block's `mmr_root`
       * 
       * The dispatch origin for this call must be `Signed` by the transactor.
