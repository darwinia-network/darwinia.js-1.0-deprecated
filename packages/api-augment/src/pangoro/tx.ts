       * must be met:
       * * A `ChillThreshold` must be set and checked which defines how close to the max
       * nominators or validators we must reach before users can start chilling one-another.
       * * A `MaxNominatorCount` and `MaxValidatorCount` must be set which is used to determine
       * how close we are to the threshold.
       * * A `MinNominatorBond` and `MinValidatorBond` must be set and checked, which determines
       * if this is a person that should be chilled because they have not met the threshold
       * bond required.
       * 
       * This can be helpful if bond requirements are updated, and we need to remove old users
